PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW
Key Insights

Education loans represent the largest share of loan originations (6,290 accounts) while maintaining a low Default Rate of 0.17% and a lower average interest rate (9.94%), indicating a low-risk, stable portfolio segment.

Home Improvement loans show the highest Default Rate (0.19%) and the highest average interest rate (10.23%), despite having lower loan volumes. This suggests higher repayment stress and elevated credit risk in this segment.

Medical (26%) and Debt Consolidation (28%) loans account for a high proportion of active loan balances, contributing significantly to portfolio exposure. Higher exposure in these categories also coincides with elevated default volumes, indicating increased risk concentration.

Default Rates remain broadly stable across credit history segments, increasing marginally from 0.28% (≤10 years) to 0.32% (>10 years). This indicates that credit length alone is not a strong standalone predictor of default risk in this portfolio.

Recommendations

Increase controlled exposure to low-risk segments such as Education loans, leveraging their stable repayment behavior.

Introduce tighter affordability thresholds and limit ticket sizes for higher-risk categories (Home Improvement, Medical, Debt Consolidation) to manage risk exposure.

Use multi-factor risk assessment rather than credit length alone when underwriting loans.

CUSTOMER RISK SEGMENTATION
Key Insights

Low-income customers account for the highest High-Risk Customer share (2.22%), while high-income customers exhibit minimal risk. This indicates that income level is a strong driver of credit risk.

Customers aged 18–24 show the highest High-Risk Customer percentage (4.28%), predominantly concentrated within middle-income bands, whereas customers aged 36–50 and above 50 exhibit negligible high-risk presence.

Employment stability is strongly correlated with risk:

Customers with 5–10 years of employment show a High-Risk share of 2.71%

Customers with 10+ years of employment show significantly lower High-Risk share (0.50%)

Home ownership status impacts risk differently:

Rented housing customers show higher Default Rates (0.20%)

Owned housing customers show higher High-Risk Customer share (2.99%), indicating potential exposure to larger ticket sizes rather than higher default frequency.

Recommendations

Restrict high-ticket exposure for low-income and younger customer segments

Prioritize employment stability and income consistency as key underwriting criteria.

DEFAULT & BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
Key Insights

Home Improvement, Debt Consolidation, and Venture loans exhibit the highest Default Rates, consistent with observed risk segmentation patterns.

The 35–50 age group contributes the highest default volume, driven by:

Highest average loan amount (₹10,736)

Highest number of defaulted accounts (5,629)
This indicates risk driven by exposure size rather than borrower count alone.

The 25–35 age group represents the largest borrower base (≈16,000 customers), indicating a growth-critical segment that requires careful risk monitoring.

Recommendation

Align loan ticket sizes with affordability indicators to reduce default risk in high-exposure age groups.

AFFORDABILITY & RISK EXPOSURE
Key Insights

High-risk exposure is concentrated entirely within the low-income segment, comprising:

699 high-risk customers

₹11+ million in High-Risk Exposure Amount

High-risk customers have an average loan-to-income ratio (percent income) of 38%, with an average income of ₹42,001, indicating significant repayment stress.

Low-risk customers (30,820 accounts) maintain a healthy average percent income of 17%, demonstrating strong affordability.

Among overleveraged customers:

195 are high risk

₹3 million in risk exposure

Default Rates are significantly higher than portfolio average

Affordable customers represent the safest segment:

30,120 low-risk customers

₹28 million low-risk exposure

Minimal default incidence

Recommendations

Introduce mandatory affordability checks, including income verification and recent salary assessment, before loan approval.

Limit loan approvals where loan obligations exceed 40–60% of customer income, especially within low-income segments.

Prioritize risk exposure reduction over volume growth in overleveraged customer groups.
